# Topographic Sand Map

A Unity project that generates a real time topographic map using the Xbox Kinect sensor. Using shaders and an alignment script, this program reads data from the depth sensor and creates a map in real time that can be projected onto the surface.

Features:
- Alignment control system
- Different color mappings
- Visual customizations
- Contour lines
